Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:
When adding # in front of these lines(seq ="" ,linenum =0),it shows name error because name 'linenum' is not defined. 
So # character is not interpreted by python and it is used to make code be read easily.
If gc_count = 0 was commented out, this name 'gc_count' is not defined. 
Because # character is not read by python as a name or variable with the value.


Problem 4:
AT-content:0.7

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:
The totalcount and seqlength are the same but the sumcount is different  in each 
file because the GC in each file has different denominator
(integer, the other :even).

Problem 7
AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8
GC Classification: moderate GC content








Collaboration:

did it by myself

Reflection:


Putting more statements in one loop makes code shorter and run faster.
